//7. ðŸ’Ž Problem Statement:
//Create a Library Management System that allows users to borrow and return books. The system
//should:
//1. Maintain a collection (HashMap) of books with their availability status.
//2. Allow users to borrow books (if available) and mark them as borrowed.
//3. Allow users to return books, updating their status.
//4. Implement custom exceptions for error handling:
//â€¢ BookNotAvailableException: If a book is not available for borrowing.
//â€¢ BookAlreadyReturnedException: If a book is returned that was not borrowed.
//â€¢ InvalidBookException: If the requested book does not exist in the library.
//Expected Output: Available Books: [Java Programming, Data Structures, AI Basics, Python Crash Course]
//User borrows: Java Programming
//Success! You have borrowed 'Java Programming'.
//User borrows: Java Programming
//Error: 'Java Programming' is currently unavailable.
//User returns: Java Programming
//Success! You have returned 'Java Programming'.
//User returns: Java Programming
//Error: 'Java Programming' was not borrowed.
